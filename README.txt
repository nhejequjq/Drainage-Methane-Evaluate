The matching analysis system of comprehensive capacities of gas drainage and coal seam charactersistics V1.0 is developed on the visual development platform of Microsoft Visual C ++ 2008.During development and test of the software, MFC visual development technology, modular design patterns and unit testing method are used.AHP-FCE model is adopted in this software to analyse coal seam characteristics and comprehensive capacities of gas drainage, achieving their evaluation grades. Then matching analysis of coal seam characteristics and comprehensive capacities of gas drainage is taken following matching regulations. In this way, the analysis result is obtained and the advice to improve gas drainage is proposed.
